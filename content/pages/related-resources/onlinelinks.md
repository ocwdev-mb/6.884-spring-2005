[Online Verilog HDL Quick Reference Guide](http://www.sutherland-hdl.com/on-line_ref_guide/vlog_ref_top.html): Very useful online reference for Verilog-1995. It won't have the newer Verilog-2001 constructs but it is still a very convenient way to look up 99% of what you need to know.

Verilog-2001: What's New: This white paper by Stuart Sutherland crystalizes the key differences between Verilog-1995 and Verlog-2001. ([PDF](http://img.cmpnet.com/eedesign/features/Verilog-2001_paper.pdf))

Parameterized Models Using Verilog 2001: This white paper by Cliff Cummings clearly describes the evils of unnamed parameter instations and 'defines and shows how the new features in Verilog-2001 provide much safer ways to achieve the same effects. ([PDF](http://www.sunburst-design.com/papers/CummingsHDLCON2002_Parameters_rev1_2.pdf))

[MIPS ISA Documentation](http://www.mips.com/content/Documentation/MIPSDocumentation/ProcessorArchitecture/doclibrary): This is the official site for the various MIPS architecture specifications. Much of the information on the MIPS32 architecture is applicable to the SMIPS ISA.
