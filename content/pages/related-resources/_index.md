[Online Verilog HDL Quick Reference Guide](http://www.emmelmann.org/Library/Tutorials/docs/verilog_ref_guide/vlog_ref_top.html): Very useful online reference for Verilog-1995. It won't have the newer Verilog-2001 constructs but it is still a very convenient way to look up 99% of what you need to know.

Verilog-2001: What's New: This white paper by Stuart Sutherland crystalizes the key differences between Verilog-1995 and Verlog-2001. ({{% resource_link ee377113-67b2-e58e-4df2-f056a0d8e619 "PDF" %}})

Parameterized Models Using Verilog 2001: This white paper by Cliff Cummings clearly describes the evils of unnamed parameter instations and 'defines and shows how the new features in Verilog-2001 provide much safer ways to achieve the same effects.

[MIPS ISA Documentation](http://www.mips.com/products/product-materials/processor/mips-architecture/): This is the official site for the various MIPS architecture specifications. Much of the information on the MIPS32 architecture is applicable to the SMIPS ISA.
